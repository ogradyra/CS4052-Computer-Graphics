# Computer Graphics Final Project - Animated Spooky Scene
This assignment involved building on the work already completed for the mid-term project. I began with the same code base I had created for the mid-term assignment, which consisted of a ground plane, camera control and one hierarchical animated spider. From there, I built a skybox around the ground plane, added some trees, increased the number of spiders and added two light sources in the form of a moon and campfire objects. I also added textures to all the objects in the scene. I implemented the Phong Illumination model on all objects in the scene coming from two separate point light sources.

Once I had completed the basic functionality required for this assignment, I attempted to implement some more advanced features. The features I was successful in implementing were a cube-mapped skybox, some collision detection, an interactive spider, more advanced hierarchical and crowd animation and more advanced lighting (Blinn â€“ Phong and simulated firelight).
